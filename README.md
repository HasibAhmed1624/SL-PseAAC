  In this work
  1. We have proposed a new dataset for DNA binding protein protection called uniprot1424.fasta and uniprot356.fasta
  2. We have proposed a super learned-based DNA binding protein prediction method.
 
 The resources attached to this repository are as follows:
 1. DataSet: This folder contains the datasets used in this work. pdb1075.fasta, pdb1035.fasta, pdb186.fasta are datasets from previous work and uniprot1424.fasta, uniprot356.fasta are new datasets.
 2. Features: This folder contains the finally selected features for our super-learned model.
 3. Images: In this folder, we have images of the distribution of our selected features.
 4. Results: The result of our experiment is placed under this folder.
 5. Scripts: Run the script in the script folder to generate results. Both scripts execute the same logic. One of them is a notebook another one is a python script.
